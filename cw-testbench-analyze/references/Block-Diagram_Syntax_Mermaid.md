### Definition and Purpose [​](#definition-and-purpose)

Block diagrams are an intuitive and efficient way to represent complex systems, processes, or architectures visually. They are composed of blocks and connectors, where blocks represent the fundamental components or functions, and connectors show the relationship or flow between these components. This method of diagramming is essential in various fields such as engineering, software development, and process management.

The primary purpose of block diagrams is to provide a high-level view of a system, allowing for easy understanding and analysis without delving into the intricate details of each component. This makes them particularly useful for simplifying complex systems and for explaining the overall structure and interaction of components within a system.

Many people use mermaid flowcharts for this purpose. A side-effect of this is that the automatic layout sometimes move shapes to positions that the diagram maker does not want. Block diagrams use a different approach. In this diagram we give the author full control over where the shapes are positioned.

### General Use Cases [​](#general-use-cases)

Block diagrams have a wide range of applications across various industries and disciplines. Some of the key use cases include:

*   **Software Architecture**: In software development, block diagrams can be used to illustrate the architecture of a software application. This includes showing how different modules or services interact, data flow, and high-level component interaction.
    
*   **Network Diagrams**: Block diagrams are ideal for representing network architectures in IT and telecommunications. They can depict how different network devices and services are interconnected, including routers, switches, firewalls, and the flow of data across the network.
    
*   **Process Flowcharts**: In business and manufacturing, block diagrams can be employed to create process flowcharts. These flowcharts represent various stages of a business or manufacturing process, helping to visualize the sequence of steps, decision points, and the flow of control.
    
*   **Electrical Systems**: Engineers use block diagrams to represent electrical systems and circuitry. They can illustrate the high-level structure of an electrical system, the interaction between different electrical components, and the flow of electrical currents.
    
*   **Educational Purposes**: Block diagrams are also extensively used in educational materials to explain complex concepts and systems in a simplified manner. They help in breaking down and visualizing scientific theories, engineering principles, and technological systems.
    

These examples demonstrate the versatility of block diagrams in providing clear and concise representations of complex systems. Their simplicity and clarity make them a valuable tool for professionals across various fields to communicate complex ideas effectively.

In the following sections, we will delve into the specifics of creating and manipulating block diagrams using Mermaid, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced configurations and styling.

Creating block diagrams with Mermaid is straightforward and accessible. This section introduces the basic syntax and structure needed to start building simple diagrams. Understanding these foundational concepts is key to efficiently utilizing Mermaid for more complex diagramming tasks.

### Simple Block Diagrams [​](#simple-block-diagrams)

#### Basic Structure [​](#basic-structure)

At its core, a block diagram consists of blocks representing different entities or components. In Mermaid, these blocks are easily created using simple text labels. The most basic form of a block diagram can be a series of blocks without any connectors.

**Example - Simple Block Diagram**: To create a simple block diagram with three blocks labeled 'a', 'b', and 'c', the syntax is as follows:

##### Code:

mermaid

```
block
  a b c
```

Ctrl + Enter|Run ▶

a

b

c

bwwdlh

This example will produce a horizontal sequence of three blocks. Each block is automatically spaced and aligned for optimal readability.

### Defining the number of columns to use [​](#defining-the-number-of-columns-to-use)

#### Column Usage [​](#column-usage)

While simple block diagrams are linear and straightforward, more complex systems may require a structured layout. Mermaid allows for the organization of blocks into multiple columns, facilitating the creation of more intricate and detailed diagrams.

**Example - Multi-Column Diagram:** In scenarios where you need to distribute blocks across multiple columns, you can specify the number of columns and arrange the blocks accordingly. Here's how to create a block diagram with three columns and four blocks, where the fourth block appears in a second row:

##### Code:

mermaid

```
block
  columns 3
  a b c d
```

Ctrl + Enter|Run ▶

a

b

c

d

y6q9q

This syntax instructs Mermaid to arrange the blocks 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' across three columns, wrapping to the next row as needed. This feature is particularly useful for representing layered or multi-tiered systems, such as network layers or hierarchical structures.

These basic building blocks of Mermaid's block diagrams provide a foundation for more complex diagramming. The simplicity of the syntax allows for quick creation and iteration of diagrams, making it an efficient tool for visualizing ideas and concepts. In the next section, we'll explore advanced block configuration options, including setting block widths and creating composite blocks.

## 3\. Advanced Block Configuration [​](#_3-advanced-block-configuration)

Building upon the basics, this section delves into more advanced features of block diagramming in Mermaid. These features allow for greater flexibility and complexity in diagram design, accommodating a wider range of use cases and scenarios.

### Setting Block Width [​](#setting-block-width)

#### Spanning Multiple Columns [​](#spanning-multiple-columns)

In more complex diagrams, you may need blocks that span multiple columns to emphasize certain components or to represent larger entities. Mermaid allows for the adjustment of block widths to cover multiple columns, enhancing the diagram's readability and structure.

**Example - Block Spanning Multiple Columns**: To create a block diagram where one block spans across two columns, you can specify the desired width for each block:

##### Code:

mermaid

```
block
  columns 3
  a["A label"] b:2 c:2 d
```

Ctrl + Enter|Run ▶

A label

b

c

d

cotx5n

In this example, the block labeled "A labels" spans one column, while blocks 'b', 'c' span 2 columns, and 'd' is again allocated its own column. This flexibility in block sizing is crucial for accurately representing systems with components of varying significance or size.

### Creating Composite Blocks [​](#creating-composite-blocks)

#### Nested Blocks [​](#nested-blocks)

Composite blocks, or blocks within blocks, are an advanced feature in Mermaid's block diagram syntax. They allow for the representation of nested or hierarchical systems, where one component encompasses several subcomponents.

**Example - Composite Blocks:** Creating a composite block involves defining a parent block and then nesting other blocks within it. Here's how to define a composite block with nested elements:

##### Code:

mermaid

```
block
    block
      D
    end
    A["A: I am a wide one"]
```

Ctrl + Enter|Run ▶

D

A: I am a wide one

kclxjj

In this syntax, 'D' is a nested block within a larger parent block. This feature is particularly useful for depicting complex structures, such as a server with multiple services or a department within a larger organizational framework.

### Column Width Dynamics [​](#column-width-dynamics)

#### Adjusting Widths [​](#adjusting-widths)

Mermaid also allows for dynamic adjustment of column widths based on the content of the blocks. The width of the columns is determined by the widest block in the column, ensuring that the diagram remains balanced and readable.

**Example - Dynamic Column Widths:** In diagrams with varying block sizes, Mermaid automatically adjusts the column widths to fit the largest block in each column. Here's an example:

##### Code:

mermaid

```
block
  columns 3
  a:3
  block:group1:2
    columns 2
    h i j k
  end
  g
  block:group2:3
    %% columns auto (default)
    l m n o p q r
  end
```

Ctrl + Enter|Run ▶

a

h

i

j

k

g

l

m

n

o

p

q

r

rezvhf

This example demonstrates how Mermaid dynamically adjusts the width of the columns to accommodate the widest block, in this case, 'a' and the composite block 'e'. This dynamic adjustment is essential for creating visually balanced and easy-to-understand diagrams.

**Merging Blocks Horizontally:** In scenarios where you need to stack blocks horizontally, you can use column width to accomplish the task. Blocks can be arranged vertically by putting them in a single column. Here is how you can create a block diagram in which 4 blocks are stacked on top of each other:

##### Code:

mermaid

```
block
  block
    columns 1
    a["A label"] b c d
  end
```

Ctrl + Enter|Run ▶

A label

b

c

d

6testd

In this example, the width of the merged block dynamically adjusts to the width of the largest child block.

With these advanced configuration options, Mermaid's block diagrams can be tailored to represent a wide array of complex systems and structures. The flexibility offered by these features enables users to create diagrams that are both informative and visually appealing. In the following sections, we will explore further capabilities, including different block shapes and linking options.
